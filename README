DNS vHost
	This software allows one to auto generate their zone files for DNS
and virtual hosts for Apache.  Data is read from a flat file with data 
seperated with ":".  The data is then inserted into a MySQL database.
More informatin on these files can be found in the data/README file.
Theroeticly you can run these programs from any host that has permissions
to access MySQL on a remote host. 

Before you begin you will have to have a MySQL server installed and
configured.  You will need the ability to create a table.  The 
schema for DNS vHost can be found in the sql directory.  Thier currently
is no install scripts.  The way to install would be to :

$ vim sql/dnsvhosts.sql 

Change the $TABLE name to the table of your choosing.  Be sure to change the 
$table variable in modules/config.pm to match that in dnsvhosts.sql.

$ mysqladmin create <yourdbname> -u username -p
$ mysql -u username -p <yourdbname> < sql/dnsvhosts.sql

To Insert and Delete Entries from the database:

dnsvhost.pl

	The doamin name passed to -z must be the same as the one in the datafile.
	Insert into database usage  : -z example.com -i <filename>
	Delete from database usage  : -z example.com -d <filename>


To generate zone files to include from an existing configured installation of
BIND and matching Virtual Hosts for adding to a vhost.d directory to be
included from your httpd.conf :

dnshostgen.pl

	dnsvhostgen.pl -z exmaple.com

The output from dnsvhostgen.pl will be placed into $outputdir located in
modules/config.pm  You will also need to change some of the variables in 
modules/config.pm to suite your configuration.

NOTE: you may need to create the directory ./out or whatever directory
your choose to for output in the moudules/config.pm module.  Also,
I'm still learning git so bear with me. :)

Good Luck!
Improvments and addions will be greatly apprecated.
