This is the format of a data file that dnsvhost.pl needs.
The format is as follows:

Host Name:IP Address:Network:Domain:Comment

test1:160:192.168.0:example.com:Test Host number 1
test2:161:192.168.0:example.com:Test Host number 2
test3:162:192.168.0:example.com:Test Host number 3
test4:163:192.168.0:example.com:Test Host number 3

them selves.
